# Javascript Simplified: Weather app

On this project from the [Javascript Simplified](https://javascriptsimplified.com) course,the goal was to fetch data from an API and update a static HTML page with said data.

This assignement introduced me to Node/Express as well as the package axios, I also learned about some browser APIs such as geolocation, and how to use the <template> element for cloning purposes.
